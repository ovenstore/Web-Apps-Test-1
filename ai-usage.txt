Prompt: 

How can I check whether crypt.randomUUID() is available in js? Don't give a function, just explain



Response:

How to check if crypto.randomUUID() is available
You check for two things:
That crypto exists
That crypto.randomUUID exists and is a function
In JavaScript, you do that by checking its type:
typeof crypto !== "undefined"
This ensures the crypto object exists.
Then:
typeof crypto.randomUUID === "function"
